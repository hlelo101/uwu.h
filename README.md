# What's this horror?
This is **uwu.h**. It uwuifies C++, also compatible with C (tho that compatibility hasn't been tested).
There's a big chance some keywords might be missing (in fact, I'm sure there's some missing), but for 
the most common uses, that should be enough.

# How can I use it?
Simply add `#include "uwu.hpp"` on top of your file, and let the magic do its thing.

# How does it work?
99% of you might have guessed it. Yes, it's a mess of `#define`s.

# Give the uwufied keywords
No. List is too long. And I'm too lazy to properly put it here. Just check `uwu.h`.

# Gib some examples
Sure! Here's one:
```c++
#include "uwu.hpp"
#include <iostream>

typeydeffies structies cuwlyoutty
	iwnt owo semies
	stddy stwing uwu semies
cuwlyinny thingy semies

iwnt mawiwn pawenthesopeny pawentheclosy cuwlyoutty
	thingy thing semies
	thing dotty owo equaly fivey semies

	stddy cowout goody "thing's owo iws: " goody thing dotty owo goody stddy endies semies
	
	stddy stwing uwuserInputty semies

	stddy cowout goody "You uwuntewed: " goody uwuserInputty goody stddy endies semies
	wetuwn zewoo semies
cuwlyinny
```
Here's one to count up to 10:
```c++
#include "uwu.hpp"
#include <iostream>

// Main function
iwnt mawiwn pawenthesopeny pawentheclosy cuwlyoutty
	// Count up to 10
	fow pawenthesopeny iwnt i equaly ony semies i smallyorequally teny semies i addyone pawentheclosy cuwlyoutty
